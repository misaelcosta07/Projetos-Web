    <p><a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> is an open-source operating system created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Inspired by Unix, it was designed to be free, flexible, and accessible for everyone. What started as a small personal project quickly turned into a global movement when developers from all over the world began contributing to its source code. Because Linux is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), anyone can use, modify, and share it freely, which helped it grow rapidly through community collaboration.</p>

    <p>Over the years, Linux became known for its stability, security, and performance. It powers millions of devices, from personal computers and web servers to smartphones and supercomputers. In fact, the Android operating system is built on the Linux kernel. Companies like IBM, Google, and Red Hat have invested heavily in Linux, making it a key part of the modern digital world.</p>

    <p>There are thousands of Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora, each customized for different needs. Developers love Linux for its command-line power, programming support, and system control.</p>

   <p> It is also the backbone of most cloud infrastructures and web hosting services today. 
    With its strong community, transparency, and constant innovation, Linux stands as a symbol of open-source freedom. Today, it is considered one of the most reliable and versatile operating systems in the world.</p>
